Phase 1: Set Up the Project

    Install Prerequisites:
        Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
        Install MongoDB and start a local MongoDB server.

    Initialize the Project:
        Create a folder for your project.
        Run npm init -y to set up package.json.

    Set Up the Folder Structure:
        Create directories for backend and frontend.
    
    Set Up Git (Optional but recommended):
        Initialize a Git repository to track your code progress.


Phase 2: Backend Development (Node.js + Express.js)

    Initialize the Backend:
        Navigate to the backend folder and run npm init -y.

    Install necessary packages:
        bash    Copy code
            npm install express mongoose body-parser cors dotenv

    Set Up Server:
        Create a basic Express server in a server.js file.
        Set up middleware like body-parser and cors.

    Connect to MongoDB:
        Use the mongoose library to connect to your MongoDB database.
    
    Define Models:
        Create a models folder.
        Define schemas for User, Admin, and Transaction.

    Create API Routes:
        Set up routes for:
            User registration and login.
            Admin login.
            Adding transactions (money received/deducted).
            Fetching transaction history and balance.
        Test APIs:
            Use tools like Postman or Thunder Client to test your APIs.


Phase 3: Frontend Development (React)
    Initialize the Frontend:
        Navigate to the frontend folder and run:
        bash        Copy code
            npx create-react-app .
    
    Set Up React Components:
    Create components for:
        Login (User and Admin).
        Dashboard (to show balance and transactions).
        Add Transaction Form.

    Set Up State Management:
        Use React's useState and useEffect hooks for managing local state.
        Optionally, use Context API or Redux for global state management (once youâ€™re comfortable).
    
    Connect to Backend:
        Use the axios or fetch API to connect the React frontend with your Express backend.
    
    Style the Frontend:
        Use CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap to speed up styling.


Phase 4: Integration and Testing
    
    Test the Entire Flow:
        Ensure user/admin authentication works.
        Test adding transactions and updating the balance.
        Validate inputs and handle errors gracefully.
    
    Debug and Refactor:
        Check for any bugs or performance issues.
        Refactor the code for readability and maintainability.


Phase 5: Deployment
    
    Deploy Backend:
        Use Render, Heroku, or Railway for hosting the backend.
    
    Deploy Frontend:
        Use Netlify or Vercel for the React app.
    
    Connect Both:
        Ensure the frontend communicates with the deployed backend by updating API URLs.


Phase 6: Learn and Iterate

    Add Features:
        Include features like monthly reports or spending categories.
        Add user notifications for low balances.

    Secure Your App:
        Implement JWT for authentication.
        Use environment variables to secure sensitive data.
    
    Monitor and Optimize:
        Use tools like Google Lighthouse to optimize performance.
        Monitor backend logs for issues.
